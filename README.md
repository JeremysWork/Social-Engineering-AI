This is our 635 AI Project. Here are some steps to use our project correctly.
First. Run the first section of code in Google Collab. This will prompt you to upload a CSV file. This will be downloaded here or through canvas.
It will take a couple minutes to sort through the dataset once you input it. After 100% run through the second block of code.
The final block of code requires human input. Here you can have the AI decide whether your code is Spam (Susupicious) or Ham (Safe). You will be prompted to enter an subject and it will run itself 10 times.
It will either determine it is Spam Or Ham. If you agree, type yes and it will knows its correct.
If it is NOT correct, type no and it will ask you to relabel it by typing Ham, or Spam. It will then save this remark into its database for further Learning. Below i'll give you an example Spam, and Ham prompt.

Each time you connect to a VPN, you’re assigned a dynamic IP. With a dedicated IP, you get one IP address in a location of your choice — and it always stays the same. "
